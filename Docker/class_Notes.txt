	Containerization using Docker!
	
	
	DevOps Stages ::
	
		- Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing 
		
		- Continuous Delivery/Deployment 		==> Prod Release 
		
		
	CI/CD Pipeline - Workflow ::: ==> Non-Containerized Applications

	Containerization : 
	
		=> Is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.
		
	Virtual Machines :
	
		- VMs are considered as Hardware Level Virtualization 
		- VMs are created using Hypervisor
		- VMs are used to Execute Operating System 
		- VMs continue to run even if there is no active application/task
		- VMs consume more space and time to start any application/task.
		
	Containers :
	
		- Containers are considered as OS-Level Virtualization 
		- Containers are created using Container Engine
		- Containers are used to Execute application/task, Not Operating System 
		- Containers will immediately go to Exit State if there is no active application/task
		- Containers consume less space and time to start any application/task.
		
			- Namespace and Control Groups are the core (Kernel) components of Operating System 
					- With this Containers run in a dedicated/Isolated address space.		
	
		- Container are used to reduce the no. of VMs 
		
		=> Containerization - Is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.

	Terminologies :::
	
		Container Engine 
			-- Is used to Create/Manage Container Images and Create/Manage and run Containers	
		
		Container Images 
			--	Is a Static file that defined the properties of the Container and its dependencies 
			--  Container Images are Non-Executables
			--  Container Images are composed of various Layers created using the Dockerfile Instructions
			
		Containers 
			--	Containers are the executable units of Container Images
			-- 	Containers are used to run the applications defined in the Container Images 		
		
		Container Registry 
			--	It is used to save and version control the Container Images 
				Dockerhub is Container Registry to be used.
				https://hub.docker.com/			
		
		Container Repositories
			--	Container Repositories are the subset of Container Registry
			
			github 			Docker-Hub_Registry
				repo1			Docker-hub_Repository1
				repo2			Docker-hub_Repository2	
	
	

Working with DockerHub :	


Install docker Container Engine in Local Machine :

	-> Install Docker in existing Jenkin_Slave Node
	-> apt install docker.io -y				# https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
	
Working Docker CLI Commands :


	-> docker --version 
	
	-> docker images 			# List the docker images in the machine 
	
	-> docker ps 				# List the active/running Containers in the machine 

	-> docker ps -a 			# List of all the active/stopped Containers in the machine

	Docker CLI Commands :
	
		- Create Containers 
		- Work with Containers 

	-> docker --version 
	
	-> docker images 				# List the docker images in the machine 
	
	-> docker ps 					# List the active/running Containers in the machine 

	-> docker ps -a 				# List of all the active/stopped Containers in the machine 	
	
	-> docker pull <image_name>		# To download the Container Image from DockerHub
	
		Eg.: docker pull alpine
		
			 docker pull centos 
			 
			 docker pull ubuntu 
			 
			 docker pull tomcat
			 
	- docker run <image_name>		# Create and execute a Container based on a image name
	
	Three Modes of Container Execution :
	Container Execution Modes ::
	
		- Foreground / Attached Mode 		# Default Mode 
		
				docker run <image_name> 
				
				Eg.: 					
					docker run alpine sleep 30
		
		- Background / Detached Mode 
			
				docker run -d <image_name> 
				Eg.: 				
					docker run -d alpine sleep 30	
		
		- Interactive Mode 
		
				docker run -it <image_name> 
				Eg.: 
				
					docker run -it alpine sh 		

					docker run -it ubuntu sh 	

	- docker start <Container_ID>		# Start a container
	
		Eg.: 
		
			docker start ab85d99cbd20
			
	- docker exec -it <Container_ID> bash		# Login to a running container
	
		Eg.: 
			docker exec -it ab85d99cbd20 bash
			
			exit								# Logoff from Container
			
			
	- docker stop <Container_ID> 
	
		Eg.: 
			docker stop ab85d99cbd20


	- Port Mapping :

	Port Mapping / Port Binding ::::
	
		- It is used to expose the container to access thru internet 
		
		- It is a process of mapping the container port with the host port.
	
	Run Application inside the Container!
	
		docker run -it tomcat:8.0 bash
		
		docker run -it -p <host_Port>:<container_Port> tomcat:8.0
		
		Eg:
		
		docker run -it -p 8089:8080 tomcat:8.0
	
		-p <host_Port>:<container_Port>

	Create Docker Images :
	
	
		docker commit ::
		
			- To Create a New Container Image based on the properties of existing Container.
			
			Syntax :

				docker commit <existing_container_id> <dockerhub_repo_name>/New_Image_Name>:<tag_Name>

			Eg.: 
				docker commit 6070980df5f2 loksaieta/sa-ai-buildimg:v1.0
		

		Publish/Push the Application Images to Container Registry. 
			
			Login to DockerHub using Docker CLI.

					- Create Access Token in DockerHub 
					
			docker login -u loksaieta
						
			Password: sdfsadfsaasdfasdfdfs
			
					
			docker push loksaieta/sa-ai-buildimg:v1.0

	

		docker build ::

		vi Dockerfile 
		
		FROM ubuntu 
		RUN apt update -y 
		RUN apt install git -y 
		RUN apt install maven -y 
		
			Syntax :

			WORKDIR									# To set the current working directory within the Container 
			CMD										# To set the default start-up command to the container 
													  This Command can be changed at run-time.
